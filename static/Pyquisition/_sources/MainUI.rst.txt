Channel Window's
------------------------------

There are two channel windows displayed in the main window (deactive and active).

   **Active Channels Window:** Positioned on the left side of the main window, this dockable window displays a list of channels that are currently being processed. These channels will be recorded in the data file and can be paused or resumed using the main menu options.

   **Deactive Channels Window:** Also located on the left side of the main window, below the Active Channels window, this dockable window shows a list of channels that are not currently being recorded. These channels can be activated by moving them to the Active Channels window.
