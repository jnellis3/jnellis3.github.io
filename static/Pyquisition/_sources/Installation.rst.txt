=====================

.. _installation:

This installation overview will guide you through the process of installing Pyquisition from GitHub. The process involves cloning the repository, installing the required packages using pip, and starting the program.

**Cloning the Repository**

    1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS).

    2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the cd command.

    3. Clone the repository by running the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        git clone git@github.com:mfrancom/Pyquisition.git

    If you need access to the respository, please contact one of the developers.

    If you need to add ssh keys to your GitHub account, follow the instructions `here <https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_.
    
    4. Navigate to the repo's source directory using the cd command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd Pyquisition/src

**Installing Required Packages**

    1. It is recommended to create a virtual environment before installing the required packages. To do this, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python3 -m venv venv

    On Windows, use python instead of python3:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python -m venv venv

    Activate the virtual environment:

        On macOS:

        .. code-block:: bash

            source venv/bin/activate

        On Windows:

        .. code-block:: bash

            .\venv\Scripts\activate

    2. Install the required packages using pip. If the repository contains a requirements.txt file, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install -r requirements.txt

    If there is no requirements.txt file, refer to the repository's documentation to find the required packages and install them using pip install package-name.

    3. Start the program from the command line:
    
        On macOS:

        .. code-block:: bash

            python3 Pyquisition.py

        On Windows:

        .. code-block:: bash

            python Pyquisition.py
