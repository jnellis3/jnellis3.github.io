  description: Pyqusition is a versatile data acquisition and instrumentation control application written in Python. The modular architecture enables a wide range and experiment setups and data collection tasks. This software was used in the testing of EXCAIM's Sub-K Cooling system and for precision measurements of cryogenic thermal contraction in materials.
