Interacting with the InstrumentRead Channel
---------------------------------------------

Once you have configured the InstrumentRead channel with the desired instrument and settings, the channel will periodically request readings from the selected instrument based on the specified timer interval. The received readings, along with the corresponding timestamps and units, will be displayed within the PyQuisition application.

You can use the InstrumentRead channel to monitor the real-time values of various instruments, such as sensors or measurement devices, integrated into your system.
